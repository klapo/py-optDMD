# pyoptDMD

Variable Projection Methods for an Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition (optDMD).

A Python implementation of code for computing optimized DMD as developed by Askham and 
Kutz (2018). This code is converted from the original [MATLAB version by Travis Askham]
(https://github.com/duqbo/optdmd).

### Current status:

The code successfully solves for dmd modes in both the Bagging, Optimized DMD and 
optDMD frameworks.
